  <h2>Technologies and Philosophy</h2>
  My expertise and interest lies in front-end technologies, including HTML/5, CSS, JavaScript (as well as frameworks like jQuery, MooTools, and Dojo Toolkit). My server side skills revolve around PHP and Python. I enjoy dabbling in mobile development and edge devices and environments. I focus on open source contributing and evangelism, as they open a world of possibilities and rewards for their hard-working developers.
  
  My philosophy on learning to use web technologies is always the same: experiment, fail, fix, fail again, fix again. Reading books will only get you so far -- you should spend time with your debugger, experimenting away with whichever technology you need to learn. Always keep an open mind, use tools you wouldn't usually use, and never give up.
  <h2>Spare Time</h2>
  When not buried in my text editor, I enjoy watching movies on one of the dozen devices Netflix has an app for, fawning over my awesome dog Ringo, and spending time with my wife, Kristina. I spend much of my weekends watching European football, cheering on the Arsenal and laughing at the misfortunes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, and Barcelona. If you're ever in the mood to get pwned, feel free to find me on Call of Duty for XBox. If you want to hear my <em>real</em> opinion on things, throw a bottle of wine at me.
